<div class="text-block">
  <p>A brand new design directive was implemented for this project at the Red Sea Mall in Doha. All models and textures had to be built from scratch because we had no reference from previous projects - super excited for this opportunity!
  <p>Business as usual with the reliable Fstorm and 3DS Max - the only difference with this project and the other MK renders is that I experimented with a different lighting technique to get a more balanced and soft lighting. I was very happy with the result below considering the scene doesn't allow environmental lighting.</p>
