  <p>I Was very lucky to sit down with the iconic Greg Chapman at <a href="http://www.chapmanskateboards.com/history/">Chapman Skateboards</a> to develop a new retail concept based on own brand analysis and research. The Unstad team consisted of Kriss Paulsen with background in brand strategy and <a href="http://itsnwa.com">Nichlas W. Andersen</a> as our Art Director.
  <p>Based on our analysis and findings I was responsible for visualizing our concept through Cinema 4D.</p>
  <p>Curious about what we found in our research? Download the <a href="Pilot Project 02.pdf">pitch</a> and see for yourself!.</p>
