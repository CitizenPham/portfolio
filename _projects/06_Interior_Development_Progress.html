  <p><b><u>April:</b> </u></p><p>After completing the shop drawings and collecting a couple of fabricator quotes I decided that I might as well produce the coffee table frame myself. After a quick search I found a workshop with all the tools required - which is part of the reason why I am now a proud member of <a href="http://www.makerspace.nyc">Staten Island Maker Space!</a> (and because I got a cool welding helmet for my birthday) </p>

  <p>I always prefer to address the most challenging part of the design first and with this design it is definitely the copper links. The part below was machined out from a CNC mill and as you can see below.</p>

<p>Next step was to order and patiently wait for the material before welding and, hopefully very little, grinding before applying the black oxide finish to the steel frame. BTW - I love my new apron from <a href="https://artisan-aprons.co.uk/product-category/stalwart-collection/">Stalwart</a> there's no coincidence of why it's in all of my shots.</p>

<p>Next I will add the "shadow" bracket and develop the wool fabric - stay tuned!</p>
