  <p>April:After finishing the shop drawings and collecting a couple of fabricator quotes I have decided that I might as well produce the coffee table frame myself. I only need a workshop with all the tools to build it which is part of the reason why I am now a proud member of <a href="http://www.makerspace.nyc">Staten Island Maker Space!</a> (and because I got a cool welding helmet for my birthday) </p>

  <p>I always like to address the most challenging part of the design first and with this design it is definitely the copper links. The part below was machined out from a CNC mill and as you can see.</p>

<p>Next step was to weld and grind the steel frame before applying the black oxide finish. BTW - I love my new apron from <a href="https://artisan-aprons.co.uk/product-category/stalwart-collection/">Stalwart</a> there's no coincidence why it's in all of my shots.</p>
