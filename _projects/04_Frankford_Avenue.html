  <p>At AZA we conducted a case study for a new residential project in Philadelphia. The architectural design is by the Principle and translated by myself into 3D. </p>
  <p>In order to meet the strict deadline and not to spent to many resource on a casestudy we were dependent on some models from Evermotion and 3D Sky. Again, I used 3DS Max with Fstorm for these renderings as well.</p>
