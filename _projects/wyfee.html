  <p><a href="http://www.reactorretail.com">Reactor Retail</a> was assigned by <a href="https://eplehuset.no">Eplehuset</a> to develop a new electronic concept store. My responsibility as a project manager was to find millworker suitable to the project scale and budget. Manage bids and coordinate with general contractors and millwork installation on site.</p>
  <p>Because of my industrial design background I was able to work closely with our millworker and develop the millwork fixtures from design sketches. We actually ended up using several millworkers for this project - some that did wood and ply only and some where steel fixture specialist. So we had to split up our production line and coordinate revisions closely!</p>
  <p>The Wyfee project was a lot of fun! Even though the deadline was super tight from design concept to execution we managed to deliver on time and within budget. Sad to see the concept terminated by Eplehuset but it was a blast to work with the reactor design team, millworkers and Wyfee exceutives! ( You know who :)</p>
