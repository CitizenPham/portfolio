<div class="text-block">
  <p>After experiencing positive feedback from the initial project we decided to move forward with 3DS Max and Fstorm as our standard 3D render workflow. In this retail project I was responsible for schematic design drafting and design development. And the client got renderings like these for each stage. Fortunately with Fstorm each frame only takes about an hour and a half to render so 8 views renders perfectly over night - no more office CPU hijacking necessary!
  <p>Since the workflow and the majority of the modeling was already done I could really dive down and tweak the material assets to become even more life like than what we did before.</p>
