  <p>In this commercial retail design project for Michael Kors I was responsible for drafting construction documents and construction administration - I was also introducing a brand new rendering worklfow to my team at <a href="http://azarchdesign.com">AZA</a>.</p>
  <p>This was our first time using 3DS Max and <a href="https://fstormrender.ru">Fstorm</a> so a lot of work was spent setting up new the workflow and watching countless of turorials by no other than <a href="http://azarchdesign.com">Johannes Lindqvist</a> - big thanks!</p>
