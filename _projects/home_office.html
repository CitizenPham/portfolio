  <p>Tired of my current home office I set off to develop my own office furniture based on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/Valchromat/about/">Valchromat</a>, plywood and standard <a href="http://bit.ly/2oyQRjW">HÃ¤fele</a> hardware.</p>
  <p>Got through design and millwork shop drawing stages. Currently "waiting" for the Valchromat MDF material prices to drop as North America is starting to get their eyes open for this exciting material.</p>
  <p>If you like the picture on the wall give go check out <a href="http://iamohoy.berta.me">Petter Bakken</a> and some of his amazing art work!
  <p>Oh, in case you were wondering this is concept is visualized in Cinema 4D and rendered with Vray. <p/>
